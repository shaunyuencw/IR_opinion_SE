# IR Opinion SE Project
This project focuses on scraping web content and analyzing it for sentiment and opinions. It utilizes external APIs for data retrieval and analysis.

## Project Structure
- Frontend: The frontend provides an interactive user interface for displaying analysis results.
- Backend: The backend handles data retrieval, sentiment analysis, and interactions with external APIs.
- Miscellaneous: You may also find other folders (i.e. Analysis, Crawler, and Classification) that support the project.

### Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to set up both the frontend and backend. Below are the links to the respective setup instructions:
