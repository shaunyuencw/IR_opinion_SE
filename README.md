# IR Opinion SE Project
This project focuses on scraping web content and analyzing it for sentiment and opinions. It utilizes external APIs for data retrieval and analysis.

## Project Structure
- Frontend: The frontend provides an interactive user interface for displaying analysis results.
- Backend: The backend handles data retrieval, sentiment analysis, and interactions with external APIs.
- Miscellaneous: You may also find other folders (i.e. Analysis, Crawler, and Classification) that support the project.

### Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to set up both the frontend and backend. Below are the links to the respective setup instructions:

### [Frontend Setup](https://github.com/shaunyuencw/IR_opinion_SE/tree/main/Frontend)
The frontend setup includes instructions on installing necessary packages and running the frontend application. Check the frontend README for complete setup guidance.

### [Backend Setup](https://github.com/shaunyuencw/IR_opinion_SE/tree/main/Backend)
The backend setup involves creating environments, installing dependencies, and configuring API keys. Follow the detailed instructions provided in the backend README to get started.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have installed the following on your local machine:

- Git (for version control)
- Frontend:
  - NPM (for managing frontend dependencies)
  - Node.js (for running the frontend application)
- Backend:
  - Anaconda or Miniconda (for managing Python environments)
  - Docker (for running ElasticSearch)

Running the Entire Application
After setting up both the frontend and backend, you can run the entire application by following these steps:

## Application
The application consists of a web interface that allows users to input a URL and retrieve sentiment analysis results. The interface also displays the sentiment score and sentiment label for the given URL.
