The number of premium subscribers increased by 25%. Due to economic uncertainty, individuals are taking steps to ensure they have the best possible opportunities to secure their desired jobs. LinkedIn has disclosed sales figures for its premium subscription service for the first time. The company's AI tools include the ability to analyze job postings and suggest suitability based on a user's resume, assist with profile optimization for recruiters, and automatically generate messages for job applications. Last year, LinkedIn laid off around 1,400 people in two rounds. The company is also focused on expanding its premium subscription service.
